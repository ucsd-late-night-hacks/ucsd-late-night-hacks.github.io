              LATE NIGHT HACKS IS A PROCEDURAL EPISTEMOLOGY PROJECT GROUP AND
              COMPUTER SECURITY CLUB AT UCSD, AN OFFSET OF CSES.

              WE WORK ON SECURITY RELATED PROJECTS, READ PAPERS, AND HOLD TALKS
              ABOUT VARIOUS SUBJECTS.

              KIND OF LIKE A CSE TOWN HALL MEETING, ONCE A WEEK.

              WE MEET ON WEDNESDAY NIGHTS AT THE CSE BUILDING BASEMENT.

              COME HANG OUT, BUILD/BREAK/HACK STUFF, SHARE KNOWLEDGE, AND GET
              INVOLVED.

              Email nbrowne [at] ucsd [dot] edu with any and all questions, and
              join our <a target="_blank"
              href="https://github.com/ucsd-late-night-hacks/"

              ``I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer science
              keep fun in computing. When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of
              course, the paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a
              while we began to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if
              we really were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of
              these machines. I don't think we are. I think we're responsible for
              stretching them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in
              the house. I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense
              of fun. Above all, I hope we don't become missionaries. Don't feel as
              if you're Bible salesmen. The world has too many of those already. What
              you know about computing other people will learn. Don't feel as if the key to
              successful computing is only in your hands. What's in your hands, I think
              and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than
              when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more.''

              Alan J. Perlis (April 1, 1922-February 7, 1990)
